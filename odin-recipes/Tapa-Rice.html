        <h3>A good, old fashioned tapa and egg duo is a classic combination any Filipino would enjoy.</h3>
        <p>Tender beef in a sweet and savory marinade, with creamy eggs to boot, is always a meal to look forward to, and breakfast lovers, especially, know this all too well. After all, who can resist the mouthwatering aroma that wafts through the kitchen whenever the classic tapsilog is the first meal of the day? That said, though a timeless favorite, plain old tapsilog may not sound like the most exciting dish in the world. So if you are craving something new, why not try this tapa and egg fried rice?</p>
